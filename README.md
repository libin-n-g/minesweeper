##Introduction
###Purpose
This Software Document describes the specification to the “Minesweeper-CLI” game we 
are to develop in the C programming language, similar to the game popularised by 
Microsoft. 
###Scope
The “Minesweeper-CLI” is a single-player puzzle video game where the objective is to clear all the 
hidden mines in a given field, without the detonation of any of them. This is done by analysing the 
board and clicking on the field units, giving us clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each 
field. This process is repetitive until and unless the player identifies the position of all the mines, 
which means, he wins the game, the other possibility being, clicking on a mine and henceforth, 
losing the game.  
             The given software is to run entirely on the Command Line Interface (CLI) and where the 
inputs are to be made through coordinate inputs through the keyboard. 
             The minefield is auto generated by the machine at the start of the game using random 
functions to allocate the mines.
